## 2. What Is Docker?

Docker is a container technologyI A tool for createing and managing containers.

#### Container 
   - A standardized unit of software
   - A package of code and dependencies to run that code (e.g. NodeJS code + the NodeJS runtime).
   - The same container always yields **exact same application and execution behavior!** . No matter where or by whom it might be executed.
   - Support for Containers **is built into** modern operating systems.
   - **Docker simplifies** the creation and management of such containers.

## 3. Why Docker & Containers?
  - ### We Want Reliability & Reproducible Environments
    - We want to have the **exact same environment for development and production=>** This ensures that it works exactly as tested
    - It should be easy to **share a common development environment** / setup with (new) employees and colleagues.
    - We **don't want to uninstall and re-install**  local dependencies and runtimes all the time
  - ### Why Containers?
    - Why would we want **independent, standardized " application packages"** ?
      - Different Development & Production Environments => We want to build and test in exactly (!) the same environment as we later run our app in.
      - Different Development Environments Within a Team / Company => Every team member should have the exactly (!) same environment when working on the same project.
      - Clashing Tools / Versions Between Different Projects => When switching between projects, tools used in project A should not clash with tools used in project B
  - ### A Containers?
    - **Standardized** unit for shipping goods
    - Can be **moved** with trucks, ships, cranes, ...
    - **Independent** from other containers
    - **Self-containing**
